[Checkstyle-report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eeropu/Search-algorithm-simulator-and-analyser/blob/master/documentation/checkstyle/checkstyle.html)
Checkstyle contains errors regarding file lenghts but I don't find it useful to break them down to subclasses because everything within them are strongly connected.
