# Week(s) 5 (9.4 - 22.4)
This week I have finished the simulation-part of this program. Now all the algorithms that were supposed to be simulatable (Best-First, Breadth-first, Depth-first, Dijkstra's and A*) can be simulated in the program. I have also made JavaDocs for everything that I have done this far. I also finished making tests for the datastructures (and I don't think it's worth it to test the algorithm automatically since they can be simulated and thus the possible errors would be found for sure).
#### Time used:
I used approximately 30 hours this week.
### Next week:
I will begin to make the speed comparison part of the program (and hopefully get pretty far with it).
### Problems:
No problems this week and the problems I've had before has now been solved.
