# Week 6 (23.4 - 29.4)
This week I was supposed to make the speedtesting part of the program, but unfortunately I got sick so I didn't get that far with it.
#### Time used:
I used approximately 8 hours this week.
### Next week:
Next week I will finish all the functionalitys of the program so that they can be shown at the demonstration session. (Finishing the documentations and the tests will be left for the last week).
