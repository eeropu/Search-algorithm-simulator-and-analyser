# Week 1 (13. - 18.3.)
This week has been mostly planning.
#### Time used:
I used approximately 3 hours this week.
### Next week
Next weeks goal is to produce a class that contains the information of a single vertex which makes saving the graph to an array easy. I'm also going to implement few of the search algorithms (propably BFS and DFS).
