# Week 7 (30.4 - 12.5.2017)
This week I finished the program.
#### Time used:
I used approximately 20 hours this week.
## problems:
I didn't manage to make the speed tester reliable. The testresult values vary very much and sometimes it gives values that should not be right; for instance it sometimes says that Breadth-first-search is significantly faster on an empty grid than Best-First-search.
