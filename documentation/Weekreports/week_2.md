# Week 2 (19. - 25.3)
This week I have made the class that represents the vertices of the graph. My plan was to also make few of the algorithms for this weeks deadline, but I decided to start making the user interface instead. The reason for this change of plans was that it's easier to test the functionality of the algorithms after the UI makes it possible to input the analysable graph. This way I don't have to come up with a temporary solution that's no use in the finished product. In addition to the vertex-class and the start of the UI I also made Queue and Stack datastructures which I will be using in the implementations of the BFS and DFS algorithms.
#### Time used:
I used approximately 8 hours this week.
### Next week:
Next weeks' goal is to continue producing the UI to the point where the graph can be input. Also few of the first algorithms will be made (BFS and DFS).
