### Automated tests
The classes inside the datastructures-package has been tested comprehensively with the JUnit-testclasses. (Linecoverage over 95 and mutationcoverage over 80). I haven't found it necessary to make tests for other classes because they are either classes regarding the UI or the algorithmclasses and I've understood that UI-test aren't required for this course.
### Manual tests
I have tested all the algorithmclasses manually by running the simulations multiple times with various different graphs and they seem to work. That's why I haven't made automated tests for them.
